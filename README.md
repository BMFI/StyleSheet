BMFI Writing styleSheet
Do not indent the first word in the first sentence of a paragraph.

For instance,This is a short example of the start of a new paragraph or first word in the first sentence of a paragraph(Which is For instance).
So, do not indent paragraphs.

You can use a space between paragraphs.
Do not use a space between sentences.
You can use either PascalCase or camelCase or the combination or mix of the two depends on your personal writing style or what your teacher verbally specifies you use in the page or document's.

Sometimes we are cramped for character space, so we do not always space stuff out. For example,
old way is good when you have enough space and the new BMFI Style is good when you do not.
Old way: This is just an instance , so the old way.
New way:This is an instance,so the new BMFI Style.

Always use alphabetical, numeric and chronological style Right to left top down style except for special circumstances like names, titles and abstacted style in reverse order or design inside out bottom to top right to left to make a point . . .

BMFI, styleSheet was created by Jeff T Rogers founder(BMFI-Advanced Teaching Systems) for Computer Science writing style, To-Boot this styleSheet can be used for purposes other than Computer Science.

Example of BMFI Citation of Reference and writing style: For instance,

Tin-Dog BootStrap v5.1 build by Jeff T Rogers(BMFI-Advanced Teaching Systems.) It is the same TinDog Dr Angela Yu teaches on Udemy and London App Brewery with Bootstrap 4. Dr. Yu thank you for your help with both the Atom IDE and TinDog. Except for I decided to do the first rollout of TinDog BootStrap v5.1 build by Jeff T. Rogers(BMFI-Advanced Teaching Systems).

Notes about this build:Thank you Dr Angela Yu ( London App Brewery-Udemy) for your help, so Dr Yu was using Bootstrap 4.0, but I decided to do the first rollout of TinDog Bootstrap v5.1.Build by BMFI Jeff T Rogers (Advanced Teaching Systems) so, there are some differences in the way style is implemented. For example, v5.1 using z-index required in-line style on the html page, but it was different for Bootstrap 4.0. The end result was different, but I thought it made the page stack differently which I thought would be useful in many applications.To-boot, I thought it looked cool so left it that way.

My Carousel slide deck has three slides and I changed two slide colors to red and blue which made the stack look over the TinDog CellPhone on slide 0 and under the TinDog CellP on slide 1 so over the TinD CellP on slide 2 and Dr Yu used only two slide decks or Carousel(0 and 1). I also used a different Icon site and different colored Icons-(Referances are cited at the bottom of this Tin Dog build).

Moreover, I implemented different Color's in the Card section. Moreover, implementing my own style and bold flair in this build using the drop down list box on the top of the page instead of click through Icons on the bottom of page for contacts, so it is different and not exactly the same as Dr Yu's build, but it is very close to fit. it is an interactive web page using Html5 CSS3 and Bootstap v5.1. I had to alter the code to make it work on GitHub.

This started as a student project TinDog BootStrap 4.0 with Dr Angela Yu as my Mentor, but I decided to do the first rollout of TinDog Boostrap v5.1. TinDog Boostrap v5.1 build by Jeff T. Rogers(BMFI-Advanced Teaching Systems).
